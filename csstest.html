        <h1>Honk Honk</h1>
        <p>The story of our bozo, JamisReebirzick, begins in 2015.<br>Now, little JamisReebirzick was only in 3rd grade. 3rd grade fucking sucked. Everyone in that grade was acting like a piece of shit, and the teachers were really gullible.<br>In spite of this, one itty bitty program would save the day.<br>That program was Scratch.</p>
        <h2>Scratch, the Savior</h2>
        <p>For the unknowing, let me explain.<br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is a website dedicated to teaching younger kids the basics of computer science and programming. The Scratch editor is a multipurpose editor, providing a graphics editor, sound editor, and program editor all in one. This environment lets kids just screw around and do whatever they wanted to <i>(within reason, of course)</i>
        <br>I started using Scratch in 2015, messing around with it very occasionaly. In May of 2016, I made <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JRR078" target="_blank">my first scratch account</a><br><br>And thus, my treacherous journey in programming started.</p>

            <h3>2016-17</h3>
            <p>Most of my Scratch projects in 2016 and 2017 were projects based off The World's Hardest Game. I think <i>too many</i> of my projects were based on it.<br>The great thing about a game like that, though, was, on paper, it was really easy to make.<br>
            My first original project, simply titled <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116144623/" target="_blank">"The World's Hardest Game"</a>, was shared on July 20, 2016.<br>
            It's shown its age. To be honest, it kinda sucks.<br>But 9 year old me was proud of it.<br>I remember showing my projects off to just about everyone I could, and people were impressed at my skills. Still, I had plenty of improvement.</p>

            <h3>2017-2018</h3>
            <p>In 2017, I still had my World's Hardest Game addiction. It was crazy. I was <i>too crazy</i> about it. But, my projects improved.<br>
            My biggest development happened in July. Previously, when I made my projects, I had to hand draw every level in the built-in paint editor. This led to very unclean levels, lines, random dots, and overall messiness.
            With my new system, though, everything was neatly stamped together, and the levels looked nice and crisp (Though the walls were mighty thick.)</p>
