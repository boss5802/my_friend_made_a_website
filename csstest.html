        <p>The story of our bozo, JamisReebirzick, begins in 2015.<br>Now, little JamisReebirzick was only in 3rd grade. 3rd grade fucking sucked. Everyone in that grade was acting like a piece of shit, and the teachers were really gullible.<br>In spite of this, one itty bitty program would save the day.<br>That program was Scratch.</p>
        <h2>Scratch, the Savior</h2>
        <p>For the unknowing, let me explain.<br>Scratch is a website dedicated to teaching younger kids the basics of computer science and programming. The Scratch editor is a multipurpose editor, providing a graphics editor, sound editor, and program editor all in one. This environment lets kids just screw around and do whatever they wanted to <i>(within reason, of course)</i>
        <br>I started using Scratch in 2015, messing around with it very occasionaly. In May of 2016, I made <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JRR078" target="_blank">my first scratch account</a><br><br>And thus, my treacherous journey in programming started.</p>
