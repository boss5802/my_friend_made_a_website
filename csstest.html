        <h1>Honk Honk</h1>
        <p>The story of our bozo, JamisReebirzick, begins in 2015.<br>Now, little JamisReebirzick was only in 3rd grade. 3rd grade fucking sucked. Everyone in that grade was acting like a piece of shit, and the teachers were really gullible.<br>In spite of this, one itty bitty program would save the day.<br>That program was Scratch.</p>
        <h2>Scratch, the Savior</h2>
        <p>For the unknowing, let me explain.<br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is a website dedicated to teaching younger kids the basics of computer science and programming. The Scratch editor is a multipurpose editor, providing a graphics editor, sound editor, and program editor all in one. This environment lets kids just screw around and do whatever they wanted to <i>(within reason, of course)</i>
        <br>I started using Scratch in 2015, messing around with it very occasionaly. In May of 2016, I made <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JRR078" target="_blank">my first scratch account</a><br><br>And thus, my treacherous journey in programming started.</p>

            <h3>2016-17</h3>
            <p>Most of my Scratch projects in 2016 and 2017 were projects based off The World's Hardest Game. I think <i>too many</i> of my projects were based on it.<br>The great thing about a game like that, though, was, on paper, it was really easy to make.<br>
            My first original project, simply titled <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116144623/" target="_blank">"The World's Hardest Game"</a>, was shared on July 20, 2016.<br>
            It's shown its age. To be honest, it kinda sucks.<br>But 9 year old me was proud of it.</p>
